# Unity iOS Save Media Plugin

>iOS Swift Unity plugin to save media into the photo library, at a specific Album.

### Motivation

I was looking for an up to date plugin based in Swift/Swift UI, but I did not found it, so that I decided to create one. I hope this can help other people.

### Reference

This plugin is a result of some questions from [this stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28708846/how-to-save-image-to-custom-album), especially [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/revisions/49843358/1)

### Specs

* Xcode 14.0
* Swift 5.7

## üíª Supported platform

This plugin is available only for Unity iOS and Swift UI. If you can help developing an Android version, it will be appreciated.

## üöÄ Ho to install

Extract and place the content of the latest release into Unity Plugins/iOS folder.

Plugins folder:
```

```

## ‚òï How to use

Call the following code in any script you want.

To save an image:
```
SaveImage(string imageNameWithExtension, string albumName, OnSuccess onSuccess, OnError onError)
```

If you have any doubt, refer to this [sample project](https://github.com/dinhonms/Lab-Unity-App)

### Troubleshooting

Disable bitcode and make a new build in order to sove this problem: 
```
error build: '.../Save Media Plugin/Frameworks/Plugins/iOS/SaveMediaToGallery.framework/SaveMediaToGallery' does not contain bitcode. You must rebuild it with bitcode enabled (Xcode setting ENABLE_BITCODE), obtain an updated library from the vendor, or disable bitcode for this target. file '.../Save Media Plugin/Frameworks/Plugins/iOS/SaveMediaToGallery.framework/SaveMediaToGallery' for architecture arm64
```
